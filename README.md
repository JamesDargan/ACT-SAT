## Problem Statement:

Every year, large and small media outlets run articles discussing the relative performance of students from different states on college prep exams. A state in the top 5 ranking for average test scores can earn positive media coverage, but how accurately do these averages convey quality of state education systems. We explore the relationship between participation rates and state averages, documenting the systematic bias introduced by state policies regarding test participation. Specifically, we explore how expanding test access can drive down state averages as more mid-tier students participate compared to low-participation states where only the most elite students self-select into test participation.

## Executive Summary

We find that on average, a percent increase in student participation on the ACT correlates with a change in state average ACT composite score. This trend holds across each subject score. Similarly, we find a percent increase in SAT participation correlates with a change in state average SAT score. Utilizing 3 case studies, we provide evidence of a causal connection to support our intuition. 


## Implication

Media reports on relative rankings of states based on average test scores skews public perception of state education performance.
